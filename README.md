To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, you will first need to clean the data by removing or correcting any errors, missing values, or inconsistencies. 

After cleaning the data, you can conduct exploratory data analysis, which involves exploring the relationships between variables and identifying patterns and trends in the data. This can be done by visualizing the data using graphs, charts, and statistical analysis techniques to gain insights into the dataset.

For example, when analyzing the Titanic dataset, you could explore factors such as survival rates based on factors like passenger class, age, gender, and embarkation point. By examining these relationships and patterns in the data, you can uncover valuable insights that can help in further analysis or decision-making.
